# Online Education System Exploration

## Dataset

This dataset aims to analyze the impact of online education by checking out the satisfactory level of the learners with respect to certain
features including internet facility, study time (Hours), gender, online performance and other features. The dataset can be found here:

## Summary of Findings

Even though there was a feature that displayed online performance scores that may have implied a significant association with the various satisfaction levels, during my investigation I found that certain students' satisfaction levels read bad even though they had 100% online performance.
Other feature including internet facility, online mode interaction & clearing doubts with faculties tend to have a stronger correlation with satisfaction levels. Also students in urban region  participated more in the online education system.
The process of the exploration also showed that the number of hours spent is not directly proportional to the performance online.
For the multivariate analysis plots on correlation, the following was discovered:
- The result of the correlation plot shows a level of increase above the 60% online performance score for students who had elderly people monitor them (we could liken that to mentor or offline instructors).
- The result of the correlation plot shows a level of increase above the 60% online performance score for students who had separate room for studying.
- The result of the correlation plot shows a level of increase above the 60% online performance score for students who were not involved in any sports with focus on the average and good satisfaction levels.
One further intriguing discovery is that, despite the fact that men outnumber women in terms of distribution, the tone of the chart indicates that women outperformed men overall at a satisfactory level. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

Just nine of the characteristics' influences were my main concern for the presentation. I began by showing a countplot of the students satisfactory level, then I plotted a pie chart to display the distribution of students' home location.


Afterwards, I proceeded to introduce the bivariate relationship starting with:
- Relationship between Online performance and satisfaction level in online education using a violin plot.
- Countplots are used to show the relationship between student satisfaction with online learning  across Internet facility, Online mode interaction & Clearing doubts with faculties.

The remaining plots included a correlation plot between the variable of interest and other categorical variables including: students who had elderly people monitor them, students who had separate room for studying, and students who were not involved in any sports

Lastly, is the countplot of the variable of interst with the online performance across the two genders.
